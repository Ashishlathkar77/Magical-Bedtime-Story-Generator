"""
Before submitting the assignment, describe here in a few sentences what you would have built next if you spent 2 more hours on this project:

I would have added the following enhancements:
1. A more sophisticated story arc system with branching narratives based on user choices
2. Voice narration integration using a text-to-speech API
3. A story visualization component that generates simple illustrations for key moments
4. A memory system that recalls user preferences and previously generated stories for personalization
5. Age-appropriate vocabulary filtering based on reading level metrics
